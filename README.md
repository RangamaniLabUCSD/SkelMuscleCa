# SkelMuscleCa
MATLAB code for ODE-based model of calcium in skeletal muscle. The model was assembled using VCell software, and the resulting ODE model was exported to MATLAB, then altered further.

Files summary:
- SkelMuscleCa.m: current ODE function to solve for Ca2+ in skeletal muscle
- SkelMuscleCaDriver.m: Driver script to test and plot runs of SkelMuscleCa
